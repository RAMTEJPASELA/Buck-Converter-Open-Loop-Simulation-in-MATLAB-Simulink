## 🚀 Future Enhancements and Scope  

There are several opportunities to enhance the converter model for more advanced and real-world applications:

- 🔁 **Closed-Loop Control:** Implementing a PI or PID controller for output regulation under varying load/input.
- 🛠️ **Non-Ideal Component Modeling:** Include parasitic resistances, diode forward voltage drops, and switching losses.
- ⚡ **Transient Analysis:** Simulate dynamic behavior during step load changes.
- 💻 **Real-Time HIL Testing:** Use Simulink Coder for deployment on embedded platforms (e.g., Arduino, STM32).
  
These enhancements would make the model not only more accurate but also **industry-relevant**.
